# SafeRun SDKs

This directory hosts the official Python and JavaScript SDKs for the SafeRun API.

- `python/` – source for the `saferun` PyPI package
- `javascript/` – source for the `@saferun/sdk` npm package

Each SDK includes:
- typed client wrappers for SafeRun dry-run / apply / revert workflows
- unit tests (kept in-repo but excluded from publishable artifacts)
- runnable examples and integration snippets
- documentation (`README.md`) with quick start guides

See the top-level `examples/` folder for end-to-end agent integrations (LangChain, AutoGPT, webhook receivers, shell scripts).
